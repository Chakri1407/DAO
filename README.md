# Hardhat Ignition DAO Project

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) implementation using Hardhat Ignition for streamlined deployment and testing.

## Overview

This project implements a DAO smart contract system using Hardhat and Hardhat Ignition for simplified deployment management. The DAO allows members to create proposals, vote on them, and execute approved decisions on-chain.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Key Features

- Proposal creation and management
- Voting mechanism
- Token-based governance
- Automated execution of approved proposals
- Hardhat Ignition deployment system

## Development

### Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy Using Ignition

1. Configure your deployment in `ignition/modules/`:
```bash
npx hardhat ignition:deploy modules/dao.js --network <network-name>
```

2. Verify deployment:
```bash
npx hardhat ignition:verify
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

2. Update `hardhat.config.js` with your network configurations.

## Networks

- Local: `npx hardhat node`
- Testnet: Supported networks include Goerli, Sepolia
- Mainnet: Ethereum mainnet

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all core functionalities:

- Unit tests for individual contract functions
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Gas optimization tests

Run specific test files:
```bash
npx hardhat test test/DAO.test.js
```

## Security

- All smart contracts are following best practices
- Consider getting an audit before mainnet deployment
- Implement timelock mechanisms for critical functions
- Use multi-sig for administrative functions
